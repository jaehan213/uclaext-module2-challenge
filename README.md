Portfolio Page w/ Flexbox Layout

The project was completed along the guidelines for UCLA Extension's Module 1 Challenge.

The portfolio page was created using a flexbox CSS layout and includes an About Me section, a Portfolio Work section, and a Contact section. The header includes a navigation bar to navigate to specific parts of the page. The About Me section contains a short description about me, Jae Han. The Portfolio Work section displays a preview of the types of projects I have been involved in (the images of birds are placeholders to these projects). The Contact section includes links to where I can be contact, including my email, Github, and Twitter.
